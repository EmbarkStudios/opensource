## Beliefs

Why we think an open source strategy brings value to Embark.

0.  **It's the right thing to do.**

    Our computers, our software, our games, and our world run on open source. Without a thriving open source ecosystem, we would not be where we are today. To make sure we (and others) keep innovating, we contribute back to this ecosystem and advocate an open and collaborative games industry.

1. **Supporting open tools is more efficient than building our own**

    The era of massive closed-source gaming engines and bespoke, proprietary tooling is coming to an end. Today, the open source community is thriving and building amazing and innovative tools. By investing in or contributing to these open tools, we can build and innovate quickly at a lower cost while enabling others to innovate.

2. **Sharing our work gives us new perspectives**

    Instead of working in isolation, we can share what we're building with the world. This gives us unique insights from people outside of the company and even outside of the industry, which can help us innovate.

3. **Being transparent helps us find collaborators**

    By sharing what we're interested in and working on, we can start to have conversations with others who are interested in collaborating with us. We may even find unlikely partnerships outside our immediate network and industry.

## Strategy

How we engage with open source as a company.

ðŸ—ƒ **Open-source by default.**

We don't open source everything, but we do open-source our projects where it makes sense. If we develop something that is reusable, not tied to proprietary systems or game products, and will be maintained for the foreseeable future, we make it public.

(See our [how-to guide](how-to.md) for information about assessing whether to open-source a project)

ðŸŽ¤ **Lead the conversation.**

We will be working in a lot of spaces where there are big problems with no clear answers. Embark should drive open conversations around solving these problems, acting as a "thought leader" in the space.

ðŸ’¶ **Support strategically.**

We believe in giving back to the community and in supporting developers who are making great things, and we strategically invest in projects and developers that support our goals. This can involve monetary sponsorship of individuals or projects, or contract work for specific tasks.
