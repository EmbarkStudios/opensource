# How to Open Source at Embark

> This document covers the basics of working with open source projects at Embark

## New Projects

### Should I open-source it?

You've got a new project - great! At Embark, we believe most things should be open-sourced by default, but there are a few questions you should ask yourself before publishing.

- **Is it useful to someone else?**
    - The answer is usually yes (even for small or "obvious" things) but consider whether your project could be useful to someone outside the organisation.

- **Does it rely on internal or proprietary systems?**
    - We don't want to release anything that could harm Embark from a security or intellectual property perspective. We also don't want to release something that doesn't work for non-Embarkers because it relies on an internal system. **You need to consult with your manager to assess any risks associated with releasing your project.**

- **Can you commit to maintaining it and answering issues and PRs for the foreseeable future?**
    - If no, you can still release ["as-is"](#repository-types) in an archived GitHub repository.
   
- **Is it high enough quality?**
    - Not every project will be mindblowing and innovative (and that's perfectly ok!), but our open source work is still a representation of the company. All repositories should have a minimum level of documentation and the code should be clean and readable. The community team and your manager should review the repository before release and suggest improvements.
    - Keep an eye out for stray comments and commit messages - the public will see them!
    
### Step-by-step

1. Create a new private or internal repository on GitHub using the [open source template](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/opensource-template). If you already have a repository and want to maintain the commit history, you can instead add the following components:
    - README
    - CODE_OF_CONDUCT
    - LICENSE
    - CONTRIBUTING
    - Issue and PR templates
1. Customise the README for your project by adding the appropriate name, description, links, and badges. This is also a great time to pick an emoji for the project!
1. Send the private repo link to the community team and your manager.
1. Make the repository public!
    
## Repository Types

**maintained**: this repository has a maintainer who is actively developing it and reviewing contributions

**as-is**: this repository could still be useful, but doesn't have an active maintainer. It is archived on GitHub.
